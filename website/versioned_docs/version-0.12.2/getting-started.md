```

## 2. Auto-fix issues

```bash
npx agnix --fix .
```

## 3. Install globally (optional)

If you use agnix regularly:

```bash
npm install -g agnix
```

Then run with:

```bash
agnix .
```

See [Installation](./installation.md) for Homebrew, Cargo, and binary options.

## 4. Target a specific tool

Validate only configs relevant to a single tool:

```bash
agnix --target claude-code .
agnix --target cursor .
agnix --target copilot .
```

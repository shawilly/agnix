# agnix

agnix is a linter for AI agent configuration files. It validates Skills, Hooks, Memory, Plugins, MCP configs, and more across Claude Code, Cursor, GitHub Copilot, Codex CLI, and other tools.

```bash
npx agnix .
```

## What it does

- **Validates** configuration files against 229 rules derived from official specs and real-world testing
- **Auto-fixes** common issues with `--fix`
- **Integrates** with VS Code, Neovim, JetBrains, and Zed via the LSP server
- **Runs in your browser** - [try the playground](/playground) with zero install
- **Outputs** in text, JSON, or SARIF for CI integration

## Next steps

- [Playground](/playground) - try it now, no install needed
- [Getting Started](./getting-started.md) - install and run in 60 seconds
- [Rules Reference](./rules/index.md) - browse all 157 validation rules

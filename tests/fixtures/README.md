# Fixtures

This directory contains fixture files used by unit and CLI integration tests.
Keep fixtures minimal, deterministic, and focused on one rule family when possible.

## Conventions
- Use `tests/fixtures/valid` and `tests/fixtures/invalid` for general file-type fixtures.
- Use family-specific directories for rule-family coverage and cross-platform cases.
- Prefer filenames that hint at the rule or scenario (`xml-001-unclosed.md`, `pe-002-cot-on-simple.md`).
- Valid fixtures should avoid triggering diagnostics for their own family.

## Notes
- AGENTS.md and cross-platform fixtures intentionally overlap; they are validated by different rule families.
- `real-world/` fixtures are regression tests derived from testing against 121 real-world repositories.
- REF-002 only fires on agent config files (CLAUDE.md, AGENTS.md, SKILL.md), so broken-link fixture uses CLAUDE.md.
- Keep fixture paths stable, as tests assert on filenames.
- Kiro powers/agents/hooks/MCP fixture packs are guarded by inventory and CLI smoke-baseline checks in `crates/agnix-cli/tests/kiro_fixture_inventory.rs`, including detection baselines and representative file-type assertions.
- Kiro MCP file-type detection currently only matches `.kiro/settings/mcp.json`; other JSON files in `kiro-mcp/.kiro/settings/` are fixture artifacts and are not detected as `KiroMcp`.
